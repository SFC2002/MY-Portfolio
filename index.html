<h2>Profile:</h2>
<p>I am a selfe proclaimed computer programmer. 
    <br>I just began my learning jorney to becoming <br>
a full-stack web developer, and I am currently taking <br>
a course called "The Complete 2023 Web- <br>
 Development Bootcamp" taught by Dr.Angela Yu. <br>
This is the first programming class I have ever taken <br>
but I have no doubt I will progress very quickly. <br>
I am described by instructors and
classmates as being <br> an
outstanding worker,
highly motivated, with
a positive <br> attitude. I am also
known for
following directions very
well, <br> and for learning/mastering objectives
quickly. My dream <br>
career would be to become a full-stack web developer <br>
so I can solve real problems and influence the <br>
world positively!
